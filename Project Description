#Introduction
Due to Covid 19, mobility behaviors of people has changed based on certain criterias. Because of certain lockdowns, online working, increased demand on market shopping and pharmeutical needs peoples mobility habits changed compared to a normal time.
In this project, I will work on Google Mobility Data and Apple Mobility Data in order to reveal the peoples mobility behavior in the Covid 19 period. 
I will visualize the datasets and find out certain anomalies, trends and insights on these datasets.


Datasets Used : Datasets used in this project includes the Google Mobility Dataset and Apple Mobility Dataset.

#Google Mobility Dataset
The dataset shows the information about the mobility change to certain places during the COVID 19 period. The data is based on geographical location. 
#Attributes
• Retail & recreation: Places include restaurants, cafes,shopping centers, theme parks,museums, libraries, and movie theaters.

• Transit stations: Places such as bus, subway and train stations.
• Workplaces: Places of work. 
• Residential: Places of Residence. 
• Dataset shows the percentage change of mobility on these specific places above from the baseline value. Baseline value is the median value of 5 week duration from Jan 3 -February 6 2020.

#Apple Mobility Dataset:
The Dataset consists of information of whether the mobility was done by walking or driving based on geographical locations. Similar to Google Mobility Dataset, it shows the change of percentage from the baseline.
